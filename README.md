# Odin_Project_5_Calculator

The last project under foundation course - building a calculator.

Project is completed for:

1. UI with clickable buttons and style.
2. Perform single operation (eg. 1 + 1 = 2)
3. Perform multiple operations (eg. 1 + 1 * 2 = 4)
4. Backspace button to reenter number
5. Clear button to perform calculation from start.
6. Decimal button can be pressed only once (i.e not possible to key in "1.2.345" or "1..2345").

For future enhancement:
1. To allow key press for the calculator (not just button click)
