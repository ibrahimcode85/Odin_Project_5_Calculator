update 'operator' function to: 
1. remove operator styling when another operator is being selected.
2. save the current number as previousNumber varioable, and reinitilased currentNumber variable. Note: do this before updating the operation variable and only when operation variable was blank (to avoid issue when operator is reselected.)
